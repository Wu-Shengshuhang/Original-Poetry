《青玉案·寒夏》
苍茫漫道求真路。
越关山，衡东海。
梦里七千三百遍。
独处一折，寒梅空展，堆雪卧枝旁。
白莲志存孤立己。手握红旗斗争去。
君道芳腊传千里。
革命不朽，火炬过头，点亮人间万千秋。

《Tune: “Green Jade Table” — Lantern Festival Night》
Along a vast and open road stretching into the unknown, resolve to seek the truth stands unshaken.
Crossing endless mountain passes and spanning the Eastern Sea.
In dreams, seven thousand three hundred times over.
Alone, the cold plum blooms in silent glory; its sturdy boughs, though burdened with snow, stand unyielding.
Like a white lotus, its mind set on solitary virtue; with the banner of struggle in hand, marching forth.
Even in the frost of winter, path exudes a fragrance that travels a thousand miles — a testament to indomitable life, unyielding in struggle.
Revolution eternal, the torch held high, illuminating countless ages of mankind.
