《念奴娇·君先行》
千里江山，击万浪，今朝谁与争流？
蟒枪游龙，翻五岳，麻履踏破千州。
戏马青峻，予命苍天，昊明敢登先。
繁锦上花，几度黄梁归墟。

或为他乡旧旅，人面两相顾，怎奈旧识！
青山代代，齐携手，诸位追赴急潮。
长缨在手，君行为寻早，东方欲晓。
肝胆上勇，几何骇浪石礁。

《Niannujiao·Refraining from Leading Off.》
Vast rivers and mountains stretch for miles, striking ten thousand waves;
who now dares contend with the current?
The spear coils like a python, and when wielded, it dances like a soaring dragon;  
cross the five majestic peaks, treading across a thousand lands in humble shoes.
Riding with effortless mastery over the lofty, treacherous heights,
granted the decree of the heavens, dare to ascend to the summit of sun and moon.
Upon splendid brocade, yet more flowers bloom in radiant splendor;
how many times home is left behind, yet steadfast resolve endures;
through countless raging waves and jagged reefs we press forward.

Even in distant lands, the traveler walks untroubled;
across differences of skin, speech, and history, two hearts gaze and recognize one another;
like old acquaintances, we converse with ease.
Through endless generations, the green mountains endure;
hand in hand, we walk the path ahead;
all rush forth to meet the surging tide.
With the long rein firmly in hand, one moves early, seeking the lead;
the East is about to dawn.
Upon bold resolve, surpassing courage shines;
through countless raging waves and jagged reefs we press forward.
